# Some info about me and my skills

Let's run a command whoami :)

### 1. Tell me about yourself.

   As a full stack developer with over 10 years of experience, I have successfully delivered web
   applications in various domains, such as delivery service, CRM/ERP, and API development. I have a
   strong background in computer science and a bachelor's degree from Technical University.

   My core competencies include Laravel, Vue.js, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, nosql databases,
   PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and AWS. I follow domain-driven development and modern principles,
   design patterns, and clean code programming, such as SOLID, OOP, DRY, KISS, and PSR. I also have
   experience in code review, mentoring, and Agile/Scrum methodologies. At my most recent role at
   Marvel Distribution, I streamlined the onboarding process for new engineers by creating
   comprehensive guides and how-tos on the technologies used by the team. I also contributed to a side
   project at Realant, an intellectual copyright protection platform, where I was responsible for new
   features development, troubleshooting, problem-solving and bug fixing.

   I am passionate about creating high-quality, scalable, and secure web applications that solve realworld
   problems and add value to users and clients. I am always eager to learn new technologies and best
   practices, and to collaborate with other developers and stakeholders. I am looking for new
   opportunities to apply my skills and expertise in a challenging and rewarding environment.

   And as for now I am embarking on a journey of transition, I am gradually shifting my programming
   focus towards Python. With its simplicity, versatility, and extensive community support, Python offers
   a promising path for exploring diverse realms of software development, data analysis, and beyond. As
   I navigate this migration, I anticipate unlocking new opportunities and honing my skills in this
   powerful language.

### 2. How can you be helpful?

   I believe my background as a full-stack web developer uniquely positions me to deliver fast and highquality services to
   your customers. With expertise spanning both front-end and back-end
   technologies, I am equipped to tackle the entire development process, from crafting intuitive user
   interfaces to implementing robust server-side functionalities. This comprehensive skill set enables me
   to optimize performance, troubleshoot effectively, and ensure seamless integration across all aspects
   of web development. As a senior web developer, I am committed to leveraging my experience to drive
   innovation, elevate user experiences, and deliver exceptional results for your organization and its
   customers.

### 3. Where do you see yourself in five years?

   I think I will master my skills in software architecture and become a principle architect.

### 4. Are you comfortable working with a team of developers to create a single website or application?

   I am absolutely comfortable working in a team because there is such things as distributed version
   control systems (VCS) like GIT or centralized VCS like SVN.

### 5. What are some of the most important skills for a senior web developer to have?

   They are:

   1) a good understanding what tech stack is better to use for a fast and scalable development,
   2) deciding if it is going to be a Domain-driven or Test-driven development
   3) following modern design patterns like in a book “Gang of four” and understanding which pattern is
      worth using in any given situation
   4) following Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation,
      Dependency Inversion principles (SOLID).
   5) following Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and Keep It Simple and Straightforward (KISS)
   6) being a good team member

### 6. How would you describe the relationship between front-end and back-end development?

   Now days front-end is communicating with back-end via API and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   methods: PATCH PUT POS DELETE and GET. The back-end returns result with data and a HTTP status
   code like 200, 500, 404 and so on.

### 7. What is your process for testing a new website or application before releasing it to the public?

   Usually I use unit testing or integration testing and also deploying a new feature into testing server
   following Continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CI/CD) software
   development practice and after deploying app to testing environment I test it myself or delegate the
   manual testing process to testing team.

### 8. Provide an example of a time when you had to make a difficult decision regarding a website project.

   It was about whether to deal with a lot of bad legacy code base and refactoring it or to start that project
   from ground up and use modern tools/best practices in building + documenting a software app so that
   there would not be no need to come up with a decision to rewrite the code again.

### 9. When approaching a new project, how do you decide which features to include and which to leave out?

   I use the task decomposition technique which uses the divide and conquer approach. Estimating size,
   effort, and cost is performed in a stepwise manner by breaking down a project into the main functions
   or related software engineering activities. After that, we discuss the essential features on a team
   meeting including business/data analysts, product owner, project manager. Then, I delegate tasks
   between team members, and we do 2-week sprints using task manager like Jira in a Scrum/Agile kind
   of methodologies.

### 10. How can Page Visibility API be useful?

   It can use-full in enhancing user experience and optimizing performance in conjunction with JS or JS
   frameworks in web development. Here's how it can be beneficial:

   1) Optimizing Performance: By detecting when a page is hidden or visible, you can optimize your web
      application's performance. For instance, when a user switches to another tab or minimizes the
      browser window, your application can pause non-essential processes such as animations, AJAX
      requests, or background tasks, conserving system resources.
   2) Managing Resources: With the Page Visibility API, you can intelligently manage resources based on
      whether the page is visible to the user or not. This can include pausing media playback, deferring the
      loading of heavy content, or suspending real-time updates that aren't crucial when the user isn't
      actively viewing the page.
   3) Enhancing User Experience: By utilizing the Page Visibility API, you can create a more seamless and
      responsive user experience. For example, you can pause autoplay videos or audio when the user
      switches tabs to prevent unwanted distractions, improving usability and user satisfaction.
   4) Monitoring User Engagement: The visibility state of a page can provide insights into user behavior
      and engagement. By tracking when users switch tabs or leave the page, you can gather data on session
      duration, user attention span, and overall interaction patterns, which can inform decisions for
      optimizing content and features.

### 11. Tell me about an application you regularly use. How would you improve its functionality?

   I use a lot of different kind of apps. I would like them to be more private, secure and loyal to their
   users. For example, messenger apps like WhatsApp. I am not quite sure nobody has access to my chats
   with my family and friends. More over, it doesn't have a setting like hiding my phone number from
   other users which are not in my contact list. Showing my phone number could help hackers steal my
   personal information and use it in their illegal needs.

### 12. You have an idea you want to try out quickly. What tools would you use to prototype it?

   I often use tools like PHP or JS Sandboxes like https://phpsandbox.io or https://jsfiddle.net
   Besides that, I use Figma. This tool allows me to create wire-frames and prototypes quickly without
   writing code. It is great for visualizing my ideas and iterating on the design before diving into
   development.

### 13. Walk me through the process of creating a web page from scratch.

   1) Planning and Design: Start by planning the layout and functionality of my web page. Consider what
      elements I need, how they will be organized, and how users will interact with them. Use Figma (or
      another design tool of my choice) to create wire-frames or mock-ups of my web page. Design the user
      interface, including navigation menus, buttons, forms, and content sections.
   2) Setting Up the Project: Create a new directory for my project on my local machine. Inside the
      project directory, create files for my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code.
   3) HTML Structure: Open my preferred text editor and create an HTML file (e.g., index.html). Define
      the basic structure of my web page using HTML tags such as <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>.
      Link my CSS and JavaScript files using <link> and <script> tags within the <head> section.
   4) CSS Styling: Create a CSS file (e.g., styles.css) to style my web page. Use CSS rules to apply the
      design elements from my Figma mock-up, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. Apply styles to
      HTML elements using selectors like classes, IDs, or element types.
   5) PHP Integration: PHP files typically have the extension .php. Create a PHP file (e.g., index.php) for
      server-side processing. I can embed PHP code within HTML using <?php ?> tags. For example, I might
      use PHP to include header and footer files, process form submissions, or fetch data from a database.
      Ensure my server environment (e.g., Apache or Nginx) is properly configured to parse PHP files.
   6) JavaScript Interactivity: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) to add interactivity to my web page.
      Use JavaScript to enhance user interactions, validate forms, create animations, or fetch data
      asynchronously from a server. Write event listeners to respond to user actions such as clicks, mouse
      movements, or keyboard inputs.
   7) Testing and Debugging: Open my HTML file in a web browser to preview my web page. Test the
      functionality of my PHP scripts by submitting forms or interacting with dynamic content. Use browser
      developer tools to inspect elements, debug JavaScript code, and optimize performance.
   8) Deployment: Once I am satisfied with my web page, upload my files to a web server using FTP or a
      file manager. Ensure that my server environment supports PHP (if applicable) and configure any
      necessary server-side settings. Test my deployed web page on different devices and browsers to ensure
      compatibility and responsiveness.

### 14. What makes you stand out from other candidates for a job as a Senior Web Developer?

   With my substantial expertise and extensive background in web development, I am confident that I am
   uniquely positioned to deliver swift, high-quality services to your esteemed customers.

### 15. How Do You Prioritize Your Work?

   I list my tasks for a day. Sort them out by the urgency and priority. Besides that, I always consider
   deadlines.

### 16. Provide a basic overview of push technology. What are its benefits and drawbacks?

   Push technology redefines how data is disseminated by enabling servers to proactively deliver
   information to client devices. This approach facilitates instant updates and notifications, enhancing
   user engagement and providing seamless access to real-time information.
